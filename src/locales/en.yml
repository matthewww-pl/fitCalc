    subtitle: "Calculation of the caloric demand"
    text: "Eating cut off is not enough to build muscle mass. It is similar when reducing body fat. Starving yourself to lose unnecessary ballast as quickly as possible will lead to significant muscle decline. In addition, the specific supply of individual macronutrients is crucial here, especially if you expect to see your own muscles in the mirror, not fat."

    subtitle: "Calculating your body mass index"
    text: "Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of your body fat percentage based on your weight to height ratio. It helps you determine if your weight is normal or if you are underweight, overweight or obese. BMI can be used to assess the risk of developing certain health problems. For example, people with a higher BMI are believed to be more likely to develop high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, and high cholesterol."
